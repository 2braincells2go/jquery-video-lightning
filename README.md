jQuery Video Lightbox
=====================

Simple jQuery plugin that turns any element into a lightbox link for Youtube and Vimeo videos. 

Why?
----
Lots of reasons. The main one, and the reason we built it, is for quick video explainers in the appropriate places. This little plugin bootstraps getting those helpful little videos in place.

How?
----
Simple. Add the js and css to your project (along with jQuery), add the class `.video-link`, add the appropriate data atrributes like so `data-video-id="XbTtgr8J8uU"`, and enjoy your video lightbox enhanced element!
